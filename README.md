# Image Editor using Python

## Introduction
The **Image Editor** is a Python-based application that provides essential image editing functionalities such as cropping, rotating, resizing, applying filters, and adjusting brightness/contrast. It is designed to be a lightweight and user-friendly tool for quick image modifications.

## Features
- **Open and Save Images** – Load images from the system and save the edited output.
- **Resize and Crop** – Adjust image dimensions or crop to specific areas.
- **Rotate and Flip** – Rotate images by any angle or flip them horizontally/vertically.
- **Filters and Effects** – Apply grayscale, blur, sharpen, and other effects.
- **Brightness and Contrast Adjustment** – Modify image brightness and contrast dynamically.
- **Undo and Redo** – Allows step-by-step undo/redo functionality.
- **GUI Support** – Interactive user interface using Tkinter or PyQt.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and manipulation.
- **PIL (Pillow)** – Handling image file formats and transformations.
- **Tkinter/PyQt** – GUI framework for user interaction.
- **NumPy** – Optimized numerical operations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd image-editor
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python pillow numpy tkinter
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python image_editor.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. The user loads an image into the editor.
2. The selected operation (resize, crop, filter, etc.) is applied using OpenCV or Pillow.
3. The modified image is displayed in real-time within the GUI.
4. The user can undo/redo changes and save the final output.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional filters and AI-based enhancements.
- Adding drawing tools for annotations and editing.
- Integration with cloud storage for saving and sharing images.
- Batch processing for editing multiple images at once.
